## Project Summary
Our project is about creating an application that can help students trying to decide between classes pick the best class for them based on whether they value a higher GPA or better professor rating. It will chose the best class and professor for that class based on the GPA for that professor’s class section using Professor Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider’s dataset and the professor’s rating from RateMyProfessor’s data. The application will allow the user to add the courses they’re interested in, then move the slider to show whether they prefer a higher GPA or a better rated professor to rank the sections.They’ll be able to see the ordered list with the professor, class, professor rating and GPA.
